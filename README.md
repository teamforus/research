## POC stages:
First, the POC gets defined in an **issue**. 

### Issue
1: proposal ([example](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues/36))  
2: fill-template ([template-example](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/blob/master/workflow_template.md))  
3: unassigned

When it is assigned, the assignee can create a **feature branch** with a **project folder** and a **readme** where the POC can be built and documented.
